-/***********************************************************************
- *
- * Caller:	ProcXListInputDevices
- *
- * This is the implementation-dependent routine to initialize an input
- * device to the point that information about it can be listed.
- * Some implementations open all input devices when the server is first
- * initialized, and never close them.  Other implementations open only
- * the X pointer and keyboard devices during server initialization,
- * and only open other input devices when some client makes an
- * XOpenDevice request.  If some other process has the device open, the
- * server may not be able to get information about the device to list it.
- *
- * This procedure should be used by implementations that do not initialize
- * all input devices at server startup.  It should do device-dependent
- * initialization for any devices not previously initialized, and call
- * AddInputDevice for each of those devices so that a DeviceIntRec will be
- * created for them.
- *
- * The default implementation is to do nothing (assume all input devices
- * are initialized during X server initialization and kept open).
- * The commented-out sample code shows what you might do if you don't want
- * the default.
