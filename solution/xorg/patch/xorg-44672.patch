+ * Determine the major and minor version of the DRI2 extension.

+ * Provides a mechanism to other modules (e.g., 2D drivers) to determine the
+ * version of the DRI2 extension.  While it is possible to peek directly at
+ * the \c XF86ModuleData from a layered module, such a module will fail to
+ * load (due to an unresolved symbol) if the DRI2 extension is not loaded.

+ * \param major  Location to store the major verion of the DRI2 extension
+ * \param minor  Location to store the minor verion of the DRI2 extension
+ *
+ * \note
+ * This interface was added some time after the initial release of the DRI2
+ * module.  Layered modules that wish to use this interface must first test
+ * its existance by calling \c xf86LoaderCheckSymbol.
