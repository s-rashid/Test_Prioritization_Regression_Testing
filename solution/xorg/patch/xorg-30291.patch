+ *  RedirectDrawAutomatic
+ *	A redirected window which clips parent and sibling drawing.
+ *	Contents for these windows are manage inside the server.
+ *	These windows get an internal clip list equal to their
+ *	geometry.
+ *  RedirectDrawManual
+ *	A redirected window which does not clip parent and sibling
+ *	drawing; the window must be represented within the parent
+ *	geometry by the client performing the redirection management.
+ *	Contents for these windows are managed outside the server.
+ *	These windows get an internal clip list equal to their
