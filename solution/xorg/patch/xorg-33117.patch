  *     inputInfo.pointer

- *     physical device is connected and does not have a visible cursor.
- *     Before the integration of MPX, any core request would operate on the
- *     VCP/VCK. Core events would always come from one of those two. Now both

  *     is the core keyboard ("virtual core keyboard", "VCK", "core keyboard").
