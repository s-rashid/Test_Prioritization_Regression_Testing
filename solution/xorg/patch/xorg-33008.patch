-/**
- * pDev is the slave device that is about to send an event. If it is attached
- * to a master device, then we need to send a mapping notify to the client.
- * To do so, we need to remember the last master device that sent a mapping
- * event.
- *
- * Mapping notify needs to be sent in the following cases:
- *      - different slave device on same master
- *      - different master
- *
- * Call this just before processInputProc.
- *
- * XXX: They way how the code is we also send a map notify if the slave device
- * stays the same, but the master changes. This isn't really necessary though.
- *
- * XXX: this gives you funny behaviour with the ClientPointer. When a
- * MappingNotify is sent to the client, the client usually responds with a
- * GetKeyboardMapping. This will retrieve the ClientPointer's keyboard
- * mapping, regardless of which keyboard sent the last mapping notify request.
- * So depending on the CP setting, your keyboard may change layout in each
- * app...
