 This allows for two strategies: Either you have one filter which is reasonable
 and is being coupled to account for fast-changing input, or you have 'one for
-every situation'. You might want to have loose coupling then, i.e. > 1.
-E.g. you could start around 1/2 of your anticipated delta t and
-scale up until several motion deltas are 'averaged'.

+In the filter stats, you can see if a reasonable filter useage emerges.
