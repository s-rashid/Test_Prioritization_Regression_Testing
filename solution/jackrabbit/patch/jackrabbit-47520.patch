-/**
- * The <code>StatefullValue</code> interface defines the API used for the state
- * classes used by the {@link org.apache.jackrabbit.rmi.value.SerialValue} class.
- * <p>
- * This is a marker interface with two purposes; it separates the value
- * state classes from the more general value classes, and it forces the
- * state classes to be serializable. This interface is used only internally
- * by the State pattern implementation of the
- * {@link org.apache.jackrabbit.rmi.value.SerialValue} class.
- * <p>
- * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients. Rather any of
- * the concrete implementations of this class should be used or overwritten as
- * appropriate.
