-/**
- * This is a marker interface that can be used by client code
- * to inform the repository that this listener should only be
- * invoked for local changes.
- * Local changes are changes happening on the same node in a 
- * clustered environment.
- * If there is no clustered environment, changes are always
- * happening on the "current node" and therefore this listener
- * is treated like a usual event listener.
- * 
- * Please note: if the jcr implementation does not value this
- *              interface, the listener is still invoked for
- *              all changes happening in the repository.
- *              Therefore it is advisable to check the repository
- *              implementation on startup if this feature is
- *              required! The {@link javax.jcr.Repository#getDescriptor(String)}
- *              method with {@link #OPTION_LOCAL_EVENT_LISTENER} can
- *              be used to test the implementation.
