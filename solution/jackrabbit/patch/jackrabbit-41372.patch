- * Selects a subset of the nodes in the repository based on node type.
- * <p/>
- * A selector selects every node in the repository, subject to access control
- * constraints, that satisfies at least one of the following conditions:
- * <ul>
- * <li>the node's primary node type is {@link #getNodeTypeName nodeType},
- * or</li>
- * <li>the node's primary node type is a subtype of
- * {@link #getNodeTypeName nodeType}, or</li>
- * <li>the node has a mixin node type that is
- * {@link #getNodeTypeName nodeType}, or</li>
- * <li>the node has a mixin node type that is a subtype of
- * {@link #getNodeTypeName nodeType}.</li>
- * </ul>
- * <p/>
- * The query is invalid if {@link #getNodeTypeName nodeType} or
- * {@link #getSelectorName selectorName} is not a syntactically valid JCR name.
- * <p/>
- * The query is invalid if {@link #getSelectorName selectorName} is identical
- * to the {@link #getSelectorName selectorName} of another selector in the
- * query.
- * <p/>
- * If {@link #getNodeTypeName nodeType} is a valid JCR name but not the name
- * of a node type available in the repository, the query is valid but the
- * selector selects no nodes.
